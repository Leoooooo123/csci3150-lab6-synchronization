# **CSCI3150 - IPC-Synchronization Problem** {#csci3150--ipcsynchronization-problem}

In this lab, you will see some synchronization problems between processes and learn how to solve them.

## You need to do: {#you-need-to-do}

* Understand POSIX semaphore APIs \(Section 3\) and shared memory APIs \(Section 4\) before try programs in this lab.

* There are few programs in this lab, compile them, run them, understand them.

* Finish exercise.

## After that, you should know: {#after-that-you-should-know}

* What race condition and critical region is.
* What semaphore and shared memory is.
* How to use POSIX named semaphores to solve synchronization problem between processes.
